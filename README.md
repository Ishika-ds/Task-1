# Task-2
# Student Grade Calculator 📊🎓

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates decision making, loops, and functions by calculating student grades based on their marks and displaying encouraging messages.

# Project Description
The program asks the user for a student’s name and marks (0–100), validates the input using a while loop, determines the grade using if-elif-else conditions, and displays the final result with an encouraging message.

This project helps in understanding conditional statements, loops, functions, and input validation in Python.

# Features
-Uses input() to take student name and marks
-Validates marks to ensure they are between 0 and 100
-Uses if-elif-else statements for grading logic
-Implements while loop to handle invalid inputs
-Uses functions to organize code
-Displays encouraging messages for each grade

# Grading Logic

A: 90 – 100
B: 80 – 89
C: 70 – 79
D: 60 – 69
F: 0 – 59

# Sample Output

Enter student name: Priya
Enter marks (0-100): 85

RESULT FOR PRIYA:
Marks: 85/100
Grade: B
Message: Very Good! Keep it up! 👍
