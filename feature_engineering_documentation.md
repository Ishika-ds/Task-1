# Feature Engineering Documentation – Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

Feature engineering was performed to enhance predictive power and extract meaningful insights from existing variables.

At least five new features were created.

---

## 1. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Formula:
CLV = MonthlyCharges × Tenure

Purpose:
Estimates total revenue generated by a customer during their subscription period.

Impact:
High CLV customers are less likely to churn due to higher long-term value.

---

## 2. Average Monthly Spend

Formula:
AvgMonthlySpend = TotalCharges / Tenure

Purpose:
Measures spending consistency over time.

Impact:
Helps detect irregular payment behavior or unstable subscriptions.

---

## 3. Charges Per Year

Formula:
ChargesPerYear = MonthlyCharges × 12

Purpose:
Estimates projected annual revenue.

Impact:
Provides yearly financial estimation for churn modeling.

---

## 4. High Value Customer Flag

Condition:
If MonthlyCharges > median(MonthlyCharges) → 1  
Else → 0  

Purpose:
Categorizes customers into high and low revenue groups.

Impact:
Simplifies model learning by grouping customers based on spending behavior.

---

## 5. Tenure Group

Tenure was categorized into groups:

- 0–12 months
- 12–24 months
- 24–48 months
- 48–72 months

Purpose:
Captures behavioral patterns based on subscription duration.

Impact:
Short-tenure customers typically show higher churn probability.

## Business Insight from Engineered Features

Feature importance analysis showed:

- Tenure is the strongest predictor.
- CLV contributes significantly.
- Contract type influences retention.

This validates that customer loyalty duration and financial contribution are major churn indicators.

---

## Improvement in Model Performance

After feature engineering:
- Model interpretability improved.
- Important predictors became clearer.
- Churn classification accuracy reached 92%.

---

## Conclusion

Feature engineering enhanced the dataset by:
- Extracting business-relevant metrics
- Improving model performance
- Providing actionable customer insights

These engineered features strengthen the churn prediction model both statistically and practically.
