# Task-3  
# Sales Data Analysis 📈💰

This is a beginner-friendly **Data Analysis mini-project** using Python and the **pandas** library.  
The project analyzes a simple sales dataset to extract meaningful insights such as total revenue, average sales, and the best-selling product.

---

## Project Description

The program loads a sales dataset from a CSV file and performs basic data analysis tasks such as:
- Exploring the dataset
- Handling missing values
- Calculating important sales metrics

Finally, it generates a clean, formatted sales report that summarizes key insights from the data.

This project helps in understanding **pandas basics**, **data cleaning**, **grouping operations**, and **basic reporting** in Python.

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `Date` – Date of the sale  
- `Product` – Product name  
- `Quantity` – Number of items sold  
- `Price` – Price per item  
- `Customer_ID` – Unique customer identifier  
- `Region` – Sales region  
- `Total_Sales` – Total revenue for each transaction
